# The College Hub

## Problem

MANIT is a large college with numerous events happening throughout the year. However, many of these events often go unnoticed by students, even when they are of significant importance. This lack of awareness is a common pain point for students at the college.

- Aggregates information about events, news, and important updates within the college.
- Ensures that students and users stay up-to-date with campus activities.
